//const age = '18';
//if ( age === 18)//Dont need a else block because there is only one thing to check 
//console.log(`You just became an adult ${age} (strict)`);//will not do type coercion
//here === is a strict equality operator it checks for value and type
//if ( age == 18)//will do a type coercion after typing loose in console log 
//console.log(`You just became an adult ${age} (loose)`);//turns string into number 
prompt("how old are you?")//user input is always a string
