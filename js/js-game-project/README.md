# Dino Game

## Overview
Dino Game is a simple JavaScript-based game where the player controls a character (Dino) that jumps over obstacles. The objective is to score as many points as possible by avoiding obstacles that appear on the screen.

## Features
- **Jumping Mechanic**: The Dino can jump over obstacles using the spacebar.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Players can select the difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) which affects the speed of the obstacles.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases over time as the player successfully avoids obstacles.
- **Game Over State**: The game ends when the Dino collides with an obstacle, displaying a "Game Over" message.

## Files
